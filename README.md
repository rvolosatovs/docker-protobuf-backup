$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -w $(pwd) znly/protoc --python_out=. -I. myfile.proto
```

## Google Well Known Types
They are embedded in the image and are included by `protoc` automatically.
They accessible via `google/protobuf/`:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";
import "google/protobuf/duration.proto";
```

## Image Size
The current currently sits at ~135mb and one layer. Most the space is spent on Go tools.
